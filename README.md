# Flutter Study Jam 
This is the repository used for the Flutter Study Jam, base level, hosted in Milan on the 8th of June 2019 at Mikamai's offices.

The material is, this time, in italian, in order to better reach the local people.

There are different branches for the different phases of the codelab, and the `gh-pages` that hosts the codelab itself.
